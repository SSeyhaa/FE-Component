                    <p class="paragraph">Automation and Supply Chain Systems Engineering (ASCSE) was established in 2022 to deals with automation and digital manufacturing. The supply chain systems engineering is also introduced to modernize manufacturing processes and optimize the whole supply chain systems. The ASCSE was established to comply with the rectangular strategies of the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) to develop human resources and digitalize manufacturing toward Industry 4.0. Also, digitalize manufacturing by integrating with supply chain systems optimization is the presence and the future for the economic development of Cambodia.

                        <br>
                        The ASCSE was established by partnership with the Sirindhorn International Institute of Cambodia (SIIT), Thammasat University (TU), Thailand to create the 2+2 Bachelor’s degree (International Program). In the 2+2 bachelor’s degree program, the students need to study Years 1 and 2 at ASCSE, RUPP, Cambodia. Then students can choose to whether they want to study Years 3 and 4 at RUPP or transfer their credits to study Years 3 and 4 at the school of Management Technology (MT), SIIT, TU, Thailand.

                        <br>
                        The ASCSE is a branch of engineering that deal with automation and supply chain operation processes. The ASCSE is designed with the following purposes:
                        Build students’ foundation in designing, operating, evaluating, and improving the automation and supply chain systems
                        Enhance their analytical and problem-solving skills
                        Develop them to become a graduated student with high intellectual capabilities
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The graduated students are ready for high demand of human resources in local and international markets. Also, the ASCSE will provide course training to related industrial partners in the field of automation and supply chain systems. This allows the industry partners to upgrade their capabilities to effectively and efficiently manage the operations and supply chain systems.</p>
